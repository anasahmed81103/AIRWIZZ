            <p>
                Air Wizz is a flight booking and management platform developed as part of a project for the
                Database Systems and Software Design & Analysis courses at FAST NUCES. This website is a
                comprehensive system for searching flights, booking tickets, managing flight schedules, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform includes features such as advanced SQL-driven search, real-time booking updates,
                profile management, and an admin portal for seamless operation. We aim to demonstrate a blend of
                strong database management and design principles alongside user-centric functionality.
